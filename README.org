* About
Blue Bird is a web interface for performing simple sentiment analysis
of twitter. It follows Jeffrey Breen's [[http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/][simple method]] of assigning each tweet a
single integer representing each tweets sentiment based off the
presence of positive and negative words. It then produces a stacked
histogram of all the tweets for a given query.

* Credit

Blue Bird's sentiment analysis R code was originally written by Jeffrey Breen. The Apache licensed code is available [[https://github.com/jeffreybreen/twitter-sentiment-analysis-tutorial-201107][here]]. The sentiment lexicon was originally compiled by Bing Liu and Minqing Hu and is available for download [[http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html][here]]. It is included in this repository by permission of the author.

* Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository or click the download button in the upper
   right hand corner.
2. Install all dependencies listed below.
3. Open settings and set the host and port to the desired values.

   Default: localhost:8348
3. Run it the script as =./bluebird= it will start out as a background
   process.
4. Visit =host:port= i.e. =localhost:8348=.
5. Enter a query and hit analyze. (There may be a long delay, the
   latency for fetching from twitter is very high)

* Usage
  Usage is relatively simple visit the webpage and enter a query then
  hit analyze and Blue Bird will search twitter, analyze the results
  and provide a stacked histogram of the results. Visit [[http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/][here]] (or read
  the source) to get a nice description of the method used to produce
  the charts before you start making conclusions. That's all you need
  to know to get started.

- How do I make it display "Python" and "Ruby" when I search
  "#python, #ruby"?

  Under show additional options there is a =Labels= option, simply
  type a comma separated list in the same order as above and the
  labels will be used in place of the search. In this case "Python,
  Ruby".

- How do I augment the word lists being used to judge the sentiment of
  a tweet?

  Under show additional options there is a positive and a negative
  words option. In their respective boxes, type a comma separated list
  of the words you'd like to augment the words list with and click
  analyze and you'll get the results.

* Adding Additional Services
By default, Blue Bird comes with one service, the tweepy interface to
twitter. However, Blue Bird is written to allow the use of multiple
services.

*What is a service?* As far as bluebird is concerned, a service as any
 python function that takes a single argument, the query, and returns
 an iterable of strings. Each string in the iterable is scored
 individually and the scores of all strings in the iterable are used
 to generate a histogram.

*How do I write one?* Open up =services.py= and look at the tweepy
 service for an example. The following is a skeleton for a service.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def myService(query):
    "My service, it's awesome!"
    # Magic happens: put your service code here
    return ["I'm happy, I wrote my first service", "I'm upset :(",
            query] # replace with any iterable of strings (iterables
            # include lists, tuples and more)
#+END_SRC

Once you've written you're service, go to the bottom of =services.py=
and add it to the SERVICES variable:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
SERVICES = [("Tweepy", getTweetsText), ("My Service", myService)]
#+END_SRC

Now restart Blue Bird and your service should be available.

* Dependencies
** Python (tested in 2.7)
Can be installed with "easy-install name"
- bottle
- rpy2
- numpy
- tweepy
** R (tested with 2.13.1)
Can be install in R with "install.packages('name')"
- plyr
- ggplot2
- stringr

* Notes
- If you get the following import error:
  : ImportError: libR.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  Then you must add the following to your .bashrc
  : export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/lib/R/lib
  /usr/lib/R/lib may be a different path depending on your R
  install. It should be replaced with the directory that contains:
  =libR.so=

- Bug when nothing returned in search. Defaults to one neutral item in
  the histogram to prevent R from raising an error.
